# Project Structure

Freight Trust Network as project is structured into a collection of loosely affiliated sub-projects with a single oversight committee.

## Network Operators Group

The Network Operators Group  (NOG) serves as an oversight committee for the community of Freight Trust Network projects. It's specific roles include:

- Management of the sub-project lifecycles
- Coordination and Mediation between various sub-projects
- Assessing Infrastructure needs for sub-projects, and making recommendations to the Corporation

### Composition

The NOG is composed of six (6) individuals who are a committer to any Freight Trust Network sub-project.

NOG members are elected for terms of 1 or 2 years.  At the end of a NOG member's term their seat is open to be filled.

The NOG can not contain more than two (2) individuals with the same company affiliation.  The intent of this restriction is to ensure diversity of the NOG composition.

In the event of two members with the same affiliation only one can hold a 2-year term.  Should both members be elected on the same cycle, the one with the highest number of votes may choose their term.  Should the votes be tied it is the member's responsibility to declare which term applies.  In the case of a conflict the remaining NOG members will choose.

Elections are held during the month of February.  The following schedule will commence on the first Wednesday:

* Day 0		Call for Nominations, email all Freight Trust Network project committers
* Day 7		Nominations close, 11:59pm ET
* Day 9		Voting period opens, all current Freight Trust Network project committers vote, vote by electronic mail or CIVS as appropriate
* Day 11	Voting period ends, 11:59pm ET
* Day 13	Election results announced

## Sub-projects
