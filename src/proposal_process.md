# Freight Trust Sub-Project Proposal Process

This document is based on the [CNCF Project Proposal Process v1.1](https://github.com/CNCF/toc/blob/40abe6f81c2b46842a87d6c47cf4190f0d8c1856/process/project_proposals.adoc).

## Introduction

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for sub-projects to be accepted into Freight Trust. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into Freight Trust, and new projects to be formed within Freight Trust. Freight Trust Leadership Committee (ZLC) will review all proposals in a timely manner.

## Sub-Project Proposal Requirements

Projects must be proposed via a Freight Trust Leadership Committee (ZLC) issue to [https://github.com/Freight Trust/zlc/issues](GitHub) with the "enhancement" label. Project proposals submitted to the ZLC must provide the following information to the best of your ability:

* Name of project (must be unique within Freight Trust)
* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
* Statement on alignment with Freight Trust mission
* Sponsor from ZLC (sponsor helps mentor projects)
* License and contribution guidelines (Freight Trust project requires code contributions to Freight Trust are to be made under the [Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL-2.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/EPL-2.0.html) and all non-code contributions are to be made under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC-BY-4.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html) unless otherwise approved by the Network Operators Group
* Source control (GitHub by default)
* External dependencies (including licenses)
* Initial committers (how long working on project)
* Infrastructure requests (CI / OMP Cluster)
* Communication channels (Telegram, irc, mailing lists)
* Issue tracker (GitHub by default, GitLab for Corporate Matters)
* Prefered maturity level (see Freight Trust Graduation Criteria below)

## Project Acceptance Process

* Projects are required to schedule and present their proposal at a Network Operators Group meeting. You can check the meeting schedules in the /cal module.
* All projects must adopt the OMP [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
* All projects agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to FreightTrust and Clearing Corporation and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones. * All projects start at the [Incubation stage](stages.md) by default unless the we approve otherwise.
